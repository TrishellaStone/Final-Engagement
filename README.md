# Final-Engagement

In this project, I will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working. 

If the alerts are working, I will then be able to monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. The findings will be reported to the manager.
